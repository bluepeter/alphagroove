# [COMPLETED] Slippage Application & Profit Target Execution Review

## Initial Problem Observation

The logged "Adj Exit" price for trades exiting with reason `[profitTarget]` did not initially appear
to consistently reflect the configured $0.01 adverse slippage. This was due to needing to clarify
the exact market price baseline used for slippage calculation in the context of the strategy's exit
execution logic (i.e., next bar open or current bar close).

## Goal

Confirm that the configured $0.01 adverse slippage is consistently applied to the market-derived
`exitSignal.price` (which is `nextBar.open` or `currentBar.close` as per strategy logic) to
calculate the final `trade.exit_price` used for P&L and logging.

## Investigation and Resolution Steps

1.  **[DONE] Plan Initialization**: Created an initial investigation plan.
2.  **[DONE] Detailed Logging**: Added temporary `console.log` statements in `src/index.ts`
    (`processTradesLoop`) to inspect intermediate values related to exit price calculation.
3.  **[DONE] Log Analysis & Root Cause Clarification**:
    - Analyzed runs for `2017-04-11` and `2017-09-29` (SPY).
    - Confirmed `applySlippage` in `processTradesLoop` correctly applies configured slippage to its
      input (`exitSignal.price`).
    - Clarified that `exitSignal.price` from strategies like `ProfitTargetStrategy` is the **open of
      the next bar** (if available within regular hours 9:30-16:00 inclusive) or the **close of the
      current bar** (if it's the last bar for evaluation). This is the market price baseline for
      slippage.
    - For the test cases, `exitSignal.price` correctly reflected the `16:00:00` bar's open when the
      PT condition was met on the `15:59:00` bar.
    - The final `trade.exit_price` (Adj Exit) consistently reflected the $0.01 slippage applied to
      this strategy-determined `exitSignal.price`.
4.  **[DONE] Data Consistency Improvement**: Implemented rounding for OHLC values in
    `fetchTradesFromQuery` (`src/utils/data-loader.ts`) to 4 decimal places. This enhances
    robustness against minor floating-point variations.
5.  **[DONE] Verification with Debug Logs**: Confirmed with debug logs that the system behavior
    aligned with the understanding from step 3 after the rounding improvement.
6.  **[DONE] Cleanup**: Removed temporary debug `console.log` statements from `src/index.ts`.
7.  **[DONE] Test Review & Validation**: Reviewed relevant tests. Existing tests for exit strategies
    and data loading are generally appropriate. The main outcome is a clearer understanding of the
    "next bar open/current bar close" price determination. No specific test changes were mandated by
    this investigation beyond standard test maintenance (e.g., ensuring test data aligns with any
    rounding if it relied on unrounded high-precision floats).
8.  **[DONE] Final System Verification**: `pnpm test` and `pnpm lint:fix` executed successfully,
    confirming system integrity.

## Conclusion

The system correctly applies slippage based on its defined exit execution logic: the raw exit price
is determined by the strategy (typically next bar open, or current bar close if it's the last bar in
the evaluation period), and then the configured slippage is applied to this price. The initial
perceived discrepancies were clarified by understanding this execution model for determining the
baseline market price for slippage. No bug in the slippage application mechanism itself was found.
The added rounding of OHLC data is a beneficial improvement for data consistency. Exit timestamps
accurately reflect the bar whose data (open or close) informed the exit price.
